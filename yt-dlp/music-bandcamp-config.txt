# Config file for yt-dlp. Lines with hash symbol are comments
# Doesn't work well for playlists, only for albums!!! (Files will be sorted into folders according to their album)
# Bandcamp works well with this config
# Soundcloud usually messes up the numbering and the release year with THIS config particularly

# Tal como no soundcloud, tb há tracks premium no bandcamp, mas estes dão um erro e não descarregam no yt-dlp, enquanto que o soundcloud descarrega só o início e não se dá conta. Ter atenção either way!! 

# Embed thumbnail and convert it to png (bcus in case we get a webm one it wont embed)
--embed-thumbnail
--convert-thumbnails png

# Best audio only quality that isn't webm, else whatever format
-f "ba[ext!=webm] / ba"

# File name formatting as absolute path - ./Album name by Artists (Year)/00. Track name
-o ./"%(album)s by %(artist)s (%(release_year)s)"/"%(playlist_index)s. %(track)s.%(ext)s"

# If there are multiple artists, remove from the path, add it manually vvvv
#-o ./"%(album)s by (%(release_year)s)"/"%(playlist_index)s. %(track)s.%(ext)s"
