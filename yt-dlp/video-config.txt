# If m4a doesn't exist, use the best audio-only that isn't .webm (it would mess with thumbnail embedding otherwise)
# If there is only .webm, then use whatever best video (up to 720p) and audio format there is (even if they're in the same stream)
# (the thumbnail embedding will force it to convert from .webm either way, probably into .mkv)
