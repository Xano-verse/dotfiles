# PICOM

The regular picom can be found [here - picom by yshui](https://github.com/yshui/picom) and the picom with animations I use can be found [here - picom by fdev31](https://github.com/fdev31/picom).

The binaries should be placed in /usr/local/bin/

picom.conf goes in ~/.config/picom/

Currently the picom binary from fdev31 is being used with the picom.conf
